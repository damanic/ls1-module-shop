Note that there is another action - {@link action@shop:checkout}, which incorporates all steps of the checkout process 
and allows to build the {@link http://lemonstand.com/docs/checkout_page AJAX-driven checkout page}, where all steps of the
checkout process are displayed one by one on a single page. That sort of checkout process is implemented in our 
{@link http://demo.lemonstand.com/basic/ Demo Store}. As contrasted with the {@link action@shop:checkout} action, 
the step-by-step checkout actions allows you to build a checkout process with separate pages. Also, using these 
actions you can customize the checkout process. For example, it is possible to skip some checkout steps and implement 
simplified checkout scenarios. Please refer to the Creating the {@link http://lemonstand.com/docs/custom_checkout_scenario_the_one_step_checkout One-Step Checkout} 
article for the example of customizing the checkout process.

<h3>Watching the cart content changes</h3>
It is possible that a customer can change the content of the shopping cart during the checkout process. 
It can be done in a separate browser window. It is recommended to check whether the shopping content has not been changed after the 
checkout process started. LemonStand automatically saves the cart content identifier to the memory on the Billing address information 
step (the first step in the checkout process). You can place the following code in the <em>Pre Action Code</em> field of the <em>Action</em> 
tab of all your checkout pages, excluding the billing address information step.
<pre>
if (Shop_CheckoutData::get_cart_id() != Shop_Cart::get_content_id())
  Phpr::$response->redirect('/checkout_billing_information');
</pre>
The code compares the saved cart content identifier with a current identifier, and if they do not match, redirects the browser 
to the first step of the checkout process. Please use an actual value for the URL of the first checkout step of your online store.
