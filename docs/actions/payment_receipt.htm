<p class="description">The shop:payment_receipt action is designed for creating an order receipt page which you can display after a successful order payment. The action provides PHP variables required for displaying the order receipt and all information related to the order.</p>

<h4 class="separated">Variables</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>$order</strong> - an order object, loaded from the LemonStand database. An object of the <a href="http://lemonstand.com/wiki/class_shop_order" target="_blank">Shop_Order</a> class. The variable could be NULL if a requested order was not found in the database.</li>
	<li><strong>$payment_processed</strong> - indicated whether payment was already processed for the order. You can use this value to display a "Order not paid" message instead of the normal receipt page. </li>	
	<li><strong>$items</strong> – a list of order items. An object of the <a href="http://lemonstand.com/wiki/class_db_datacollection" target="_blank">Db_DataCollection</a> class. Each element of the collection is an object of the <a href="http://lemonstand.com/wiki/class_shop_orderitem" target="_blank">Shop_OrderItem</a> class. This variable exists only if the requested order was found in the database.</li>
</ul>
