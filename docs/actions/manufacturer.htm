<p class="description">The shop:manufacturer action is designed for creating the manufacturer details page. On this page you can display a list of manufacturer's products. The action loads a manufacturer PHP object by a manufacturer's URL name specified in the page address and creates the $manufacturer variable.</p>

<h4 class="separated">Variables</h4>
<ul>

The variable is an instance of the <a href="http://lemonstand.com/wiki/class_shop_manufacturer" target="_blank">Shop_Manufacturer</a> class. This variable can be empty (NULL) in case if the manufacturer specified in the URL is not found.</li>
</ul>
